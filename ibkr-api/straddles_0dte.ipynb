    "# Trading 0DTE Options with the IBKR Native API\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a thing that I suspect will make money, but that I haven't yet tested (for reasons that I will explain shortly):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every day, at the start of the trading day, get the SPX straddle price and convert it to an expected SPX price move. \n",
    "- Then at the end of the trading day, take the SPX price and calculate if it moved more or less than the straddle implied. \n",
    "- Aggregate this over a few days - the simplest way would be to take the average expected move and the average actual move. \n",
    "- The trading signal for the next day's open is as follows:\n",
    "    - If SPX moved more than was implied by the straddle on average over the last few days, buy the straddle.\n",
    "    - If SPX moved less than implied on average, sell the straddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if mean(actual_move) > mean(expected_move):\n",
    "  buy tomorrow's 0DTE ATM straddle\n",
    "else if mean(actual_move) < mean(expected_move):\n",
    "  sell tomorrow's 0DTE ATM straddle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essentially fitting to how well the options market predicted spoos volatility in the very short term.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think there's *probably* an edge here, but I'm also concerned about costs, since the cost of trading a 0DTE straddle will be a large percentage of its return, most of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why haven't I tested this properly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data is hard to come by. I didn't have it at hand, and I couldn't get enough from the usual free sources to test it properly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When I have a suspicion about a possible edge, or someone tells me about an edge they have a hunch about (which is where this idea came from), I like to move fast and test it out with minimal investment in time and money. Most of the time, these things don't work out, and so I want to disprove ideas quickly and move on. To do that, you need ready access to data. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the data for this idea is a little awkward. Specifically, you need historical ATM SPXW options daily open and close prices (which I don't have). And most of the usual sources (including IBKR) don't provide data for expired contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to do instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have some options. You could go and buy the data and test it properly. Or, you could just start trading it in small size and collect the data you need along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I'm thinking about doing the latter. I like this approach because I learn a lot about the strategy by actually executing it. And if it has no edge, then the expected costs are just the trading fees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I promised I'd show you some 0DTE options stuff with the IB Native API! So here goes. \n",
    "\n",
    "*In this article, I'll show you how to calculate the signal for this strategy and place the appropriate trades via the IB Native API.*"

    "## Straddle prices and expected price moves\n",
    "\n",
    "The price of the ATM straddle allows you to estimate the expected move in the underlying that the options are pricing in. The generally accepted formula, which is just an estimate, is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta P_u = 0.85 * P_s $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_u$ is the price of the unerlying, and $P_s$ is the price of the ATM straddle. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example say our underlying was priced at $100. The ATM straddle costs $15. The expected move is therefore 0.85*15 = $12.75.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that at expiry of the straddle, we expect price to be within 100 +/- 12.75, that is between $87.25 and $112.75."

    "## Data requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For this strategy, we need the following data:\n",
    "- Daily open and close SPX prices (the open price will be our straddle strike price, and the close will allow us to calculate the actual price move)\n",
    "- Daily 0DTE ATM call and put option open prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we have the appropriate market data subscriptions, we can get daily SPX prices directly out of TWS.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Options data is more problematic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you have the appropriate subscriptions, you won't be able to get expired options contracts out of TWS. And we need a few days' worth of expired contracts to calculate our trading signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll get that data from Yahoo Finance instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can get XPSW options chains from Yahoo at this url: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/options/\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can get price data for options that haven't yet expired by selecting the expiry date from the dropdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://robotwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/yahoo_spx_option_chains.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I did some experimenting and found that you could also get price data for *recently* expired options using the following pattern for the URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPXW{expiry}{contract_type}0{strike*1000}`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `contract_type` is \"C\" or \"P\" for call and put respectively, and `expiry` is of the format yymmdd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of what's available for an option that expired yesterday:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://robotwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/recently_expired_option.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the open price on expiry day in the table, and I *think* the number in large bold is the last traded price on expiry day. I don't know whether the open price represents the mid price, the bid, the ask, the first trade, or something else.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately it seems Yahoo only makes a few days' worth of contracts available. I could find nothing older than about five days. So this data source won't be useful for backtesting, but maybe we can use it for calculating our trade signal. \n"

    "\n",
    "- Connect to TWS\n",
    "- Request four (say) days of SPX price data from TWS\n",
    "- Using SPX open prices as our strike prices, get SPXW call and put open and last traded prices on expiry day from Yahoo for the prior four days\n",

    "## Strategy implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is some Python code for implementing this strategy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose is to demonstrate how to trade options using the IB Native API. If you do trade this strategy, be aware of the following caveats:\n",
    "- I don't have confidence in it at the moment - it's only based on a hunch \n",
    "- The options data source is dubious (I don't even have confidence that the data represents what I think it does)\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, here's the code. I've heavily commented it so that you can follow along if this is new to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an introduction to the IB Native API, read [this article](https://robotwealth.com/getting-started-with-the-interactive-brokers-native-api/) first.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran this shortly after Friday's open (22 March 2024). You would need to make some modifications to run it in the future (for example update the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters that control the SPX price data download) etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I've only included the bare minimum you need to get started with a strategy such as this. In particular, I've only included the minimum order handling logic required to trade a straddle using limit orders at the current bid/ask price. I've not made any attempt to handle cases where the order isn't filled. I've also not included handling of any edge cases (for example, where an fails to be received by TWS). "
